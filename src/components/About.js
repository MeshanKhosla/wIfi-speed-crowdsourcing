          Letâ€™s be real, WiFi on campus has been terrible. It is way too often that students are unable to connect to online classes or complete their work on campus premises. __ was created with the intent to inform students of where the best WiFi spots are on campus. Through crowdsourcing, we compiled a database of real-time WiFi speed in various locations around campus. Students report their WiFi speed by going on the website and clicking on the button on the main screen. Their respective WiFi speed automatically gets recorded and saved on the database. Utilizing a serverless clustered database to store our collected data, and Microsoft Azure APIs to achieve an impeccable cloud computing experience, _ provides an amazing user experience.

          We hope you find this shared database useful in your academic endeavors on the Berkeley Campus!
